######Installing the Colored Lights API (for Devs)######

1. Download codeChickenCore(CCC) from here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1279956-chickenbones-mods  Be sure to take a dev-version (it may work with src too, we Haven't tested that) AND make sure to take the right CCC-Version for your Minecraft-Version.

2. Download coloredLightsCore(CLC) here: https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2993392-colored-light-continuation  You **DON'T** need the coloredLightsAPI, you need the normal mod!

3. Drop both(CLC and CCC) into your "path_to_working_dir/mods/" folder

4. Thats it ;)  Just Start your IDE and hit "Run-Client" (or whatever you named your Client RunConfig)


The API methods **may** be inaccessible for now, but they can be implemented relativly easily.  If you are able to access the API, please let me know, then I can update this guide!
